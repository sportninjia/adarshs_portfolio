    <p class="paragraph">I am a dedicated and ambitious student with a strong passion for STEM, robotics, computer science, and business. My hard work and perseverance have earned me recognition from the Iowa State Senate and a judge for being a good student. I actively take on leadership roles and strive to push my limits in everything I do.

        Beyond academics, I am deeply involved in robotics and STEM programs, where I develop problem-solving and teamwork skills. I have been involved in FTC since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2024, and six months later, we qualified to go to state at Iowa University. I am also passionate about business, exploring ways to combine technology and entrepreneurship to create innovative solutions.
        
        In addition to my technical interests, I enjoy cricket, dance, and basketball. I am also working on launching a YouTube channel to showcase dance performances, instrumental music, and gaming videos. With skills in HTML, CSS, and Python, I always look for new ways to grow, learn, and create something meaningful. My goal is to make an impact in both technology and business, shaping a future where I can turn my ideas into reality.
