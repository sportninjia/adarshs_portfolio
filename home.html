        <p>My name is Adarsh, and I have a strong passion for Computer Science and Business.</p>  

    <p class="one">Throughout my high school years, I actively participated in the STEM club during both my freshman and junior years.</p>  

    <p class="one">Additionally, I was involved in basketball, achieving league victory in the fourth grade and continuing to play during the eighth grade and my freshman year of high school.</p>  

    <p class="one">One of my key objectives before graduation was the development of this website.</p>
